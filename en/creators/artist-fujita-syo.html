            Expressing the natural beauty of Bizen clay as it truly is cannot be achieved overnight.
            We never compromise in selecting our clay, taking the time and care to refine it,
            and pursuing forms and expressions that best suit each material.

            Even when the results overturn conventional notions of Bizen ware,
            we continue to face its true essence.

            Beyond the traditional concept of “the beauty of utility,”
            we aim to create creative Bizen ware that transcends fixed frameworks and boundaries.

          <h2 class="section-title">About Shiro-Bizen (White Bizen)</h2>
          <div class="two-col">
            <div class="block">
              <h3>About Shiro-Bizen (White Bizen)</h3>
              <p>
                In the mid-Edo period, as the popularity of glazed wares such as Arita and Seto increased, Bizen ware—known for emphasizing the natural texture of clay—fell into decline. In response, efforts were made in Bizen to create white ceramics. In 1710 (Hoei 7), by order of the Okayama Domain, Chojiro I of Kimura Korakuen traveled to Hizen to study porcelain production techniques. By 1712 (Shotoku 2), prices for Shiro-Bizen were set, and sales outside the Okayama Domain were prohibited.

                Shiro-Bizen, created by firing white clay as-is or with glaze, stood in stark contrast to conventional images of Bizen ware and came to be known as the “phantom Bizen ware.” Because the white clay used is extremely scarce, surviving works are very rare today, and only a handful of artists currently produce Shiro-Bizen. Low-iron white clay is essential to create Shiro-Bizen, yet obtaining it is far from easy.

                During this time, I had the opportunity to encounter highly pure ceramic stone excavated from 156 meters underground at a mine in Mitsuishi, Bizen City. This soft white ore was only recently discovered by a local company, Dobashi Mining. Extracted from deep underground where neither light nor radio waves reach, it could only be obtained thanks to modern mining technology.

                I kneaded the pure white stone powder into clay, carefully formed each piece, and fired them without glaze. The resulting Shiro-Bizen possesses such high translucency that it softly allows light to pass through, embodying a dignified beauty reminiscent of an iceberg resting upon the sea. Inspired by the fleeting nature of icebergs that change shape every second in nature, combined with their rugged strength, I shaped each piece with this imagery in mind. Though Bizen clay was once thought to be fully exhausted, I was deeply moved by the richness of the earth, realizing that it still holds further potential.

                Shiro-Bizen was born from the unwavering dedication of Bizen potters and the Okayama Domain during the Edo period, who refused to give up and poured their hearts into revitalization efforts. Later, the master craftsman Tokei Mimura, renowned for his sculptural works from the Meiji to Showa periods, actively incorporated Shiro-Bizen into his creations. With deep respect for the “white” pursued by our predecessors, I now seek to revive it in a new form for the present era.
